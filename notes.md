### todo

- finish about page

  - reword about ycwd and explain the name
  - Also a general note on the writing - you have a lot of "I want to" or "I set out to" or "goal is to" but not a lot of definitive language.

  So like YCWD's goal is to make modern websites for people and businesses that need websites to just work. --> YCWD makes modern websites for people and businesses that need websites to just work.
